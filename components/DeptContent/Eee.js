                The School of Architecture is now autonomous (affiliated to VTU)
                providing scope for further improvement. The focus has been
                towards fostering novel concepts and solutions in architectural
                design. The studentâ€™s response is very encouraging and the
                school recognises and appreciates such good students by awarding
                them. Many of the students after graduation have pursued higher
                studies in various universities in the country and abroad. There
                is a good demand for the school graduates in the industry and is
                developing initiatives towards co-branding of the industry and
                the institution school. Many have started their own enterprise

                construction technology, with an emphasis on sustainable
                practices in landscape architecture. The course covers a broad
                spectrum of topics from local to regional scale. Balancing
                theory with hands-on practice, design aspects of landscape
                architecture is given equal prominence to direct the students
                towards a holistic approach to Sustainable Landscape
                Architecture. The course is structured to analyze and respond to
                critical issues facing contemporary landscape architectural
                design and development. Thus the students have the opportunity
                to explore alternative, innovative, and experimental design.

                natural processes and human activity, and how sustainable design
                fits into everyday life, explore design options to address the
