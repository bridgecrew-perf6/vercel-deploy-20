                M. S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology (MSRIT) was started in
                1962 by the late Dr. M.S. Ramaiah, our Founder Chairman who was
                a renowned visionary, philanthropist, and a pioneer in creating
                several landmark infrastructure projects in India. Noticing the
                shortage of talented engineering professionals required to build
                a modern India, Dr. M.S. Ramaiah envisioned MSRIT as an
                institute of excellence imparting quality and affordable
                education. MSRIT, a part of the Gokula Education Foundation, has
                grown over the years with significant contributions from various
                professionals in different capacities, ably led by Dr. M.S.
                Ramaiah himself, whose personal commitment has seen the
                institution through its formative years. Today, MSRIT stands
                tall as one of India’s finest names in Engineering Education and
                has produced around 35,000 engineering professionals who occupy
                responsible positions across the globe.

                have post graduate degrees and eighteen of the staff members are
                doctorates. The staff members of the Mechanical Engineering
                department have taken up a number of research projects funded by
                many external agencies like DRDO, DST, AICTE, and VTU and have
                received funding to the tune of Rs. 1 Crore. Faculty members
                from the department have published books in different domains of
                Mechanical Engineering and these books are recommended by the
                Visvesvaraya Technological University’s Board of Studies as
                reference text books. The department has also contributed in
                developing intellectual property for the institute by obtaining
