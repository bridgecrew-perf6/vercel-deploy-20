              National Service Scheme, popularly known as NSS, was launched in
              1969 under the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports Govt. of India
              in 37 Universities involving 40,000 students with primary focus on
              the development of personality of students through community
              service. This scheme requires full participation and involvement
              of the volunteers for a mandatory period of two years.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              The NSS Unit of Ramaiah Institute of Technology was first
              introduced in the year 1999 and saw a massive support by the
              students as well as the faculty. Since then, the number of
              students pledging their time and efforts to this purpose has only
              increased. NSS MSRIT is a student body organization run by the
              students of MSRIT. The ultimate goal of NSS is to imbibe a sense
              of empathy and responsibility towards the betterment of the
              country.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Some of the highlights of this scheme include a Blood Donation
              Camp that is held every year where people in large numbers turn up
              to donate their blood. The National Service Scheme (NSS) Unit of
              M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore organized the 19th
              Blood Donation Camp on the 2nd of December 2016 in memory of their
              Founder Chairman Dr. M. S. Ramaiah. The event was graced by Dr.
              Shiva Rajkumar, a renowned actor in the Kannada film industry, Dr.
              M. R. Seetharam, Minister for Planning, Statistics, Science and
              Technology and Dr. K Gayathri Reddy, VTU Officer. The number of
              people who donated their blood stands testimony to the
              overwhelming response received from the public. At the end of the
              day, 1221 units of blood were collected and 16 blood banks helped
              in making the event a grand success.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              A ten day Special Camp supported by Principal and NSS Officer is
              held wherein hundreds of boys and girls participate
              enthusiastically. Students who attend the camp are given
              certificates and are eligible for grace marks for seeking
              admission to higher courses. For the academic year 2016-17, the
              Special Camp was preceded by the Pre-camp which commenced on the
              8th of July. The major activity witnessed during the pre-camp
              involved the making of new books from used ones. These books were
              distributed to the students pursuing their studies in the schools
              that the volunteers visited. Also, an E-waste collection drive was
              held, following which a plantation drive was organized where about
              a hundred samplings were planted. The Pre-camp was followed by the
              Special Camp which started on 25th of July. The initial activity
              of the camp was the Slum Visit. Dental and eye checkups were
              conducted in all the schools and a general medical checkup was
              conducted in the slum areas. The underlying motive of this visit
              was to educate people about the importance of cleanliness, hygiene
              and sanitation. The second activity of the Special Camp involved
              the volunteers teaching in different schools. The team went to a
              total of 8 schools where they taught subjects like Basic
              Mathematics and Spoken English among others.

              The NSS team held various other events throughout the year which
              included Yoga Day (21st June 2016), Orphanage Visit (18th
              September 2016), Independence Day celebration, and National Youth
              Day (16th January 2016).

              Through this endeavor, the students not only succeed in helping
              those in need while contributing to a good cause, but are also
              made aware of the conditions prevalent in the community. The aim
              of NSS is to promote national consciousness and a sense of social
              responsibility, discipline and dignity of labour and to help
              students to develop their personality.

There are many more such endless details and I could go on in a loop talking about the things that amaze me, being a part of NSS. I am thankful to this organization for having given me an opportunity to be a part of a lot of wonderful experiences."

            quote="For those who want to give something in return to the society, NSS is a good platform. Contrary to popular belief, NSS is not just about two blood donation camps and one special camp. You can see a mini, selfless world here. In simple words, NSS not only provides service to those in need, but also gives immense happiness to the heart in doing so.”
