              The Proctorial System has been introduced with the main objective
              of providing supportive care and counsel to students in their
              academic and personal problems, from time to time, if any. This
              system helps the students complete their studies comfortably and
              successfully. The Proctorial system is used to continuously and
              regularly monitor the academic progress of the students and to
              rectify their problems. The college encourages parents to be in
              regular contact with the Proctor/Chief Proctor/HOD/Principal.

            Every teaching department implements the proctor process through its
            faculty and all the faculty members are designated as proctors.
            <br />
            <ul className="list-disc ml-7">

                The Proctor acts as a local guardian to solve the academic and

            <ul className="list-disc ml-7">
              <li>
                The Proctorial process started in the late 1990’s and started on
                full scale from the year 2002. Chief Proctor’s Office is housed
                in the first level of the Apex Block.
              </li>

              <li>
                The Proctorial Process is a supportive process, wherein the
                Chief Proctor heads the system. Each department has a deputy
                chief proctor and all the faculty members act as proctors.
              </li>

              <li>Each proctor is allotted around 20 to 25 students.</li>

              <li>
                The proctor acts as a local guardian helping to solve the
                academic and administrative problems faced by his wards, and
                would help in solving personal problems, if any.
              </li>

              <li>
                In addition to details of proctor-student meetings held from
                time to time, SIR also gives the details of the performance of
                the candidate in the semester end examination.
              </li>

              <li>
                Provision has been made to send the progress reports of each
                student to his/her parents/ guardians furnishing the details of
                attendance, class marks, examination results, etc. These reports
                are sent twice in a semester (at the end of 45 days & 90 days
                from the starting of the semester) to the parent / guardian of
                each student.
              </li>

              <li>
                The third report is sent in case of such students who fail to
                satisfy the minimum attendance requirement of 85% in each of the
                subjects and the necessary internal marks of 40% as stipulated
                by VTU norms / autonomy Regulations.
              </li>

              <li>
                The proctorial process is made more effective by web enabling
                the SIS (Student Information System) by the Contineo e-sutra
                software.
              </li>

              <li>
                Students are allowed to register the core subjects, Elective
                subjects, Practical, open elective subjects etc. through the
                SIS.
              </li>

              <li>
                Faculty members enter attendance and CIE marks in the SIS
                regularly.
              </li>

              <li>
                Each student and parent is assigned with a Login ID and
                password, which enables them to view the status of attendance,
                CIE marks, proctor notes, rolled-out timetable, exam history,
                fee details and academic events regularly.
              </li>

              <li>
                The Chief Proctor regularly conducts scheduled meetings with the
                deputy chief proctors, HODs and Principal on the Proctorial
                process.
              </li>

              <li>
                The attendance and CIE Marks entered by each faculty member on
                the SIS is constantly monitored in the Chief Proctor’s Office.
              </li>

              <li>
                The attendance and CIE Marks are displayed in the notice board
                of respective departments regularly
              </li>

              <li>
                A student whose performance is not up to the mark is asked to
                appear for counseling with the proctor/deputy chief
                proctor/chief proctor in order to help the student improve
                his/her performance in the coming semesters.
              </li>

              <li>
                The Proctorial System has received an excellent response and
                encouragement. However, continuous efforts are being made to
                give the best services from our Institution.
