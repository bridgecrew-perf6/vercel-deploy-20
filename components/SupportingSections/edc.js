                        CreatHives, an incubated company at Entrepreneurship
                        Development Cell has been able to connect to various
                        investors and grant agencies. It all began in 2011, when
                        a bunch of theatre enthusiasts from Ramaiah college were
                        asked to put up a performance for the Bangalore Mirror
                        Amateur Theatre Festival. When they showcased their act,
                        86, based on the Sri Lankan civil war, they left their
                        judge in tears. It was on that day, TEA Arts, a creative
                        arts society was formed. From enacting scripts that were
                        close to their heart to mentoring nearly 150 artists who
                        have gone on to break ground in the arenas of performing
                        and digital arts gave them immense motivation. TEA Arts
                        pioneered The Bangalore Theatre League the same year and
                        has gone on to host two consecutive leagues thereafter.
                        Simultaneously, TEA Arts, has been chosen to host
                        performance campaigns for The Times of India, Bangalore
                        Mirror, Fortis Hospitals, The Wedding Filmer,
                        Dream-ADream and CRY among a spectrum of other media,
                        profit, and not for profit. With this expansive and
                        interesting experience in their portfolio, they now
                        endeavour to scale the activities of TEA Arts both to
                        reach a wider audience pan India as well as include a
                        wider range of existing and upcoming creative arts into
                        its scale. Their vision is detailed, scalable and born
                        out of hands on experience in the field. At this
                        juncture, there is the inevitable hurdle of bringing
                        focus within the arts segment given the imbalance
                        between the market requirement and what the artists have
                        to oﬀer.It's a great new web application that enables
                        networking between artists and vendors in need of
                        artists such as NGOs, Corporate sectors, other
                        commercial set-ups, etc. CreatHives is an initiative
                        that brings to focus, the imbalance between the market
                        requirement and what the artists have to offer. We, at
                        CreatHives, cater to both ends of a creative
