              At RIT we strongly believe in the holistic development of
              students, i.e, they develop in such a way that they evolve into
              full-fledged and confident professionals by the time they
              graduate. This is made possible by encouraging them to engage in
              various cultural activities such as music, theatre, literary,
              visual & fine arts, etc. apart from Sports, NSS, Entrepreneurship
              Cell and other similar pursuits.

              Cultural Activities is not just about entertainment; they help
              molding the personality of the students and help them in the
              following ways:

                While good grades equip students to get their first jobs,
                extra-curricular activities help students to equip for their
                whole lives.

                They help inculcating in students values such as empathy, broad

              Acknowledging the importance of Cultural Activities in the overall
              development of the Students, this Institution has created a

              Activities (DECA), to oversee all such activities of students on
              campus and off-campus throughout the year.

                  </p>
                  Shoutout is the annual intra-college theatre fest held by The
                  Theatre Society exclusively for the students of MSRIT. The
                  growing passion for theatre, acting, photography,
                  play-writing, movie-making, editing, scoring background music,
                  etc., all manifest in full measure during ShoutOut. Entries
                  are open for events in One Act Plays, Skits, Movies and Short
                  Ads. Professionals are invited as judges to select the best
                  and to give away prizes.

                  <p className="font-bold">Kannada Rajyotsava</p>
                  This has always been the most celebrated event during any
                  given odd semester. Held in the month of November, Kannada
                  Rajyotsava brings out the culture of the State in full fervour
                  and colour. Eminent litterateurs and well-known actors are
                  invited to our campus to add to the celebrations. Our
                  Institute takes pride in the fact that many non-Kannadiga
                  students come forward to work as volunteers and contribute to
                  the success of Rajyotsava. Many competitive events are held
                  and prizes are distributed on the final day.

                    UDBHAV â€“ The Intercollegiate Cultural Extravaganza
                  </p>
                  Udbhav is the annual cultural extravaganza of MSRIT. Its size
                  and magnitude, has earned it a spot among the ten best college
                  fests in Karnataka, according to a survey by Deccan Herald.
                  With a footfall of approximately 15,000 people and
                  participants from over 35 colleges across Karnataka, Udbhav is
                  a melting pot of culture. It draws talented youth from across
                  the state to display their colossal talents. Spanning over 3
                  days, this fest provides a platform to its own students as
                  well as to various young aspirants across the state. The
                  events are categorized into intercollegiate and intra-college
                  to create an atmosphere of maximum exposure to the students.
                  Each year, we host 27 intra-colleges and 30 intercollegiate
                  events, which enable students to showcase their talents in the
                  fields of art, music, literature, dance and theatre, amongst
                  many others. This fest has created a niche for itself in the
                  hearts of the students, and we hope that it continues to do so
                  along with the ever enduring support from the college
                  management.

                  Every year, VTU organizes one of the most widely participated
                  Cultural Spectacle in Karnataka, at different locations
                  depending on the host college which takes up the

                  various categories such as Dance, Music, Fine Arts, Literary
                  and Theatre, are assembled before travelling together to the
                  VTU fest destination with the hope of becoming Champions every

                  been crowned Overall Champions 2 times and Runners-Up for a
                  whopping 10 times!! For sheer consistency, no other college is
                  yet to match MSRIT.
